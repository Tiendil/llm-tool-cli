# Polishing Workflow

```toml donna
kind = "donna.lib.workflow"
start_operation_id = "run_tach_script"
```

Initiate operations to polish and refine the llm-tool-cli codebase: running and fixing module-boundary checks, formatters, linting, type checking, spelling checks, and tests. This workflow MUST NOT be used to introduce new logic into the project or refactor it - only to fix existing issues.

Polishing MUST preserve intended behavior and MUST NOT weaken checker configuration merely to hide findings.
Fixes SHOULD address the cause of a finding before adding a suppression.
Suppressions MUST address understood findings, use the smallest practical scope, and respect the applicable architecture.
Use the project development environment for all checks.
Changes requiring new behavior, architectural restructuring, or an uncertain domain decision need developer authorization unless already covered by the current task.

## Run Tach

```toml donna
id = "run_tach_script"
kind = "donna.lib.run_script"
fsm_mode = "start"
save_stdout_to = "tach_output"
goto_on_success = "run_autoflake_script"
goto_on_failure = "fix_tach"
```

```bash donna script
#!/usr/bin/env bash

./bin/dev.sh uv run -- tach check 2>&1
```

## Fix Tach Issues

```toml donna
id = "fix_tach"
kind = "donna.lib.request_action"
```

```
{{ donna.lib.task_variable("tach_output") }}
```

1. Fix the Tach issues based on the output above that you are allowed to fix.
2. Ask the developer to fix any remaining issues manually.
3. Ensure your changes are saved.
4. `{{ donna.lib.goto("run_tach_script") }}`

Allowed fixes:

- Align imports with the module ownership and dependency direction specified by the architecture.
- Move the dependency to a module already allowed by the architecture.
- Invert the dependency through an existing boundary.
- Use an existing public API owned by the target module.

Do not change Tach configuration only to allow an import unless the project architecture itself is intentionally being changed.
Do not move modules or create new boundaries unless architectural restructuring is already authorized.
Ask the developer when the correct dependency direction is unclear.

## Run Autoflake

```toml donna
id = "run_autoflake_script"
kind = "donna.lib.run_script"
save_stdout_to = "autoflake_output"
goto_on_success = "run_isort_script"
goto_on_failure = "fix_autoflake"
```

```bash donna script
#!/usr/bin/env bash

./bin/dev.sh uv run -- autoflake ./llm_tool_cli 2>&1
```

## Fix Autoflake Issues

```toml donna
id = "fix_autoflake"
kind = "donna.lib.request_action"
```

```
{{ donna.lib.task_variable("autoflake_output") }}
```

Mechanical cleanup MUST preserve required dynamic behavior, public re-exports, and initialization side effects.
Inspect the purpose of any removed symbol that may serve those roles before accepting its removal.
Imports retained for side effects SHOULD make their purpose explicit enough to survive cleanup.

1. Fix the autoflake issues based on the output above.
2. Ensure your changes are saved.
3. `{{ donna.lib.goto("run_tach_script") }}`

## Run isort

```toml donna
id = "run_isort_script"
kind = "donna.lib.run_script"
save_stdout_to = "isort_output"
goto_on_success = "run_black_script"
goto_on_failure = "fix_isort"
```

```bash donna script
#!/usr/bin/env bash

./bin/dev.sh uv run -- isort ./llm_tool_cli 2>&1
```

## Fix isort Issues

```toml donna
id = "fix_isort"
kind = "donna.lib.request_action"
```

```
{{ donna.lib.task_variable("isort_output") }}
```

1. Fix the isort issues based on the output above.
2. Ensure your changes are saved.
3. `{{ donna.lib.goto("run_tach_script") }}`

## Run Black

```toml donna
id = "run_black_script"
kind = "donna.lib.run_script"
save_stdout_to = "black_output"
goto_on_success = "run_codespell_script"
goto_on_failure = "fix_black"
```

```bash donna script
#!/usr/bin/env bash

./bin/dev.sh uv run -- black ./llm_tool_cli 2>&1
```

## Fix Black Issues

```toml donna
id = "fix_black"
kind = "donna.lib.request_action"
```

```
{{ donna.lib.task_variable("black_output") }}
```

1. Fix the Black issues based on the output above.
2. Ensure your changes are saved.
3. `{{ donna.lib.goto("run_tach_script") }}`

## Run Codespell

```toml donna
id = "run_codespell_script"
kind = "donna.lib.run_script"
save_stdout_to = "codespell_output"
goto_on_success = "run_flake8_script"
goto_on_failure = "fix_codespell"
```

```bash donna script
#!/usr/bin/env bash

./bin/dev.sh uv run -- codespell ./llm_tool_cli 2>&1
```

## Fix Codespell Issues

```toml donna
id = "fix_codespell"
kind = "donna.lib.request_action"
```

```
{{ donna.lib.task_variable("codespell_output") }}
```

1. Fix the spelling issues based on the output above when the intended word is clear.
2. Ask the developer to fix any remaining issues manually.
3. Ensure your changes are saved.
4. `{{ donna.lib.goto("run_tach_script") }}`

Do not change compatibility-sensitive values unless the surrounding contract permits the correction:

- external names.
- serialized values.
- fixture data.
- command output expectations.
- URLs.
- compatibility strings.

Intentional project terminology SHOULD use the configured spelling allowlist when available.

## Run Flake8

```toml donna
id = "run_flake8_script"
kind = "donna.lib.run_script"
save_stdout_to = "flake8_output"
goto_on_success = "run_mypy_script"
goto_on_failure = "fix_flake8"
```

```bash donna script
#!/usr/bin/env bash

./bin/dev.sh uv run -- flake8 ./llm_tool_cli 2>&1
```

## Fix Flake8 Issues

```toml donna
id = "fix_flake8"
kind = "donna.lib.request_action"
```

```
{{ donna.lib.task_variable("flake8_output") }}
```

1. Fix the flake8 issues based on the output above that you are allowed to fix.
2. Ask the developer to fix any remaining issues manually.
3. Ensure your changes are saved.
4. `{{ donna.lib.goto("run_tach_script") }}`

Allowed fixes:

- `E800 Found commented out code`: remove the commented-out code unless the comment is part of documented behavior, example text, or fixture data.
- `CCR001 Cognitive complexity is too high`: when behavior is understood and complexity is accepted for the current design, add a narrow `# noqa: CCR001`; otherwise report the finding without broad refactoring.
- `F821 undefined name` when there are missing imports: add the necessary import statements at the top of the file.
- Use narrow suppressions only when you understand the finding and the suppression correctly represents the exception.

For `F821 undefined name` in all other cases, ask the developer to fix it manually. Do not guess undefined names that are not explained by missing imports.

Prefer clear, local fixes over broad refactoring.
Security findings MUST NOT be suppressed unless the reported behavior is intentional and its implications are understood; ask the developer when unclear.
For print-output findings, use the existing output or diagnostic mechanism; test fixes SHOULD follow the test's intent.

## Run Mypy

```toml donna
id = "run_mypy_script"
kind = "donna.lib.run_script"
save_stdout_to = "mypy_output"
goto_on_success = "run_tests_script"
goto_on_failure = "fix_mypy"
```

```bash donna script
#!/usr/bin/env bash

./bin/dev.sh uv run -- mypy --show-traceback ./llm_tool_cli 2>&1
```

## Fix Mypy Issues

```toml donna
id = "fix_mypy"
kind = "donna.lib.request_action"
```

```
{{ donna.lib.task_variable("mypy_output") }}
```

1. Fix the mypy issues based on the output above that you are allowed to fix.
2. Ask the developer to fix any remaining issues manually.
3. Ensure your changes are saved.
4. `{{ donna.lib.goto("run_tach_script") }}`

Missing third-party types SHOULD be addressed through maintained stubs.

Allowed fixes:

- Add missing type annotations when the annotation is directly implied by the implementation.
- Fix trivial mismatches between an annotation and the value that the code already uses.
- Add an explicit conversion when the code already implies that conversion and the conversion preserves behavior.
- Fix type conversion issues when the data is received from external sources (like a database) and the type is known to be correct.
- Add an assertion that a value is not `None` when the control flow already guarantees that condition and the assertion makes the guarantee explicit.

Changes you are not allowed to make:

- Introducing new types or protocols.
- Introducing architectural abstractions only to satisfy mypy.
- Adding or removing class attributes. If you need to do it, ask the developer to fix the problem manually.
- Adding `type: ignore[import-untyped]`. If you need to use it, ask the developer to install the missing types first or to fix the issue manually.

Follow the static typing suppression rules in `specs/architecture/entities.md`.

## Run Tests

```toml donna
id = "run_tests_script"
kind = "donna.lib.run_script"
save_stdout_to = "tests_output"
goto_on_success = "finish"
goto_on_failure = "fix_tests"
```

```bash donna script
#!/usr/bin/env bash

./bin/dev-tests.sh 2>&1
```

## Fix Test Issues

```toml donna
id = "fix_tests"
kind = "donna.lib.request_action"
```

```
{{ donna.lib.task_variable("tests_output") }}

2. Ask the developer to fix any remaining failures manually.
3. Ensure your changes are saved.
4. `{{ donna.lib.goto("run_tach_script") }}`

## Finish

```toml donna
id = "finish"
kind = "donna.lib.finish"
```

Polishing workflow completed. Report the checks performed, any unavailable checks, and unresolved findings with enough context for the developer to decide the next action.
